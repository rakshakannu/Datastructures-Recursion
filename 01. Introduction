// a way to write a program where the function calls itself
// a function is called recursive if it calls itself directly or indirectly

// direct

void funi(){
.
.
fun1();
.
.
}

// indirect

void fun1(){
.
fun2();
}

void fun2(){
.
fun1();
}

// we are going to mainly focus on direct recursion.

NOTE: java shows stackoverflow error for infinite function calls because the space in the stack is over.
we should make sure that it does not go to a never ending situation. it should be finite.
we write recursion terminating conditions that helps to have finite recursions.

// typical structure of a recursion function

fun(...)
{
base cases
...
recursice call(i.e call to the function) with atleast one change in parameter.
...
}
