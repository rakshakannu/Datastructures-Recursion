// palindrome - if we reverse the string, it should be the same
// recursion means finding solution for the smaller problems
hance method will be:
first and last characters should be same and the inner string should be a palindrome. that is how we will use recursion.

// base cases
if n=0 or n=1 return true // these are the two main corner cases.

// we create a boolean function call isPalindrome
// we are going to use two variables start and end and recursivley call

boolean isPalindrome(String str, int start, int end)
{
if(Start>=end)
  return true;
  
return(ischarAt(start)==ischarAt(end) && isPalindrome(str, start+1,end -1);
}

// note that the && operator works in a shrt circuit way.if only the first condition becomes true in the recursive statement, then only its going to male a recursive call
otherwise it is going to return false. this is called short circuiting which happens in both c++ and java.

// time: theta(n)/ O(n)
// space: recursive call of n-2, hence it is around n/2 recursive calls in the function call stack.
