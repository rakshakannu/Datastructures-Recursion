// very important problem and a tough problem
// given a rope of length n you need to find maximum no of pieces such that length of every peice is in set {a,b,c} FROM THE GIVEN THREE VALUES a,b,c.
// if you are not able to cut the pieces in nay way, then return -1.
// the length of the rope can be either a,b,c.
